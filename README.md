# Piano
Records your Piano keys to an array to save you time.
This Program is used in conjunction with an arduino that plays the piano.
You will look at a video of someone playing the piano and you will emulate that in the website.
When you are finished click Finished and a file will then be downloaded.
That file contains all the notes that you played.
Copy and paste those notes into the arduino code in the arraylist notes[]
Then upload the code to your piano robot and your robot will start playing some beutiful music.
Enjoy
